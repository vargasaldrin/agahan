First is that the size is bigger usually served in slices and another one is the brown topping you see in the photo. That topping is also made out of eggs but only egg whites, I guess it was a slight variation which gives the dish an even colour on top unlike the spotted dark spots you see in egg tarts.",

Like most Filipinos who love calling items with its brand name regardless of this brand rather than the noun that describes it, like Colgate to toothpaste, Gasul to LPG and Coke to cola. ",
